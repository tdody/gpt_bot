    "# Road to Generative AI - Part 2: Multi-Layer Perceptron\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to explore the capabilities of Generative AI. In the [first part](https://tdody.github.io//bigram-and-nn/) of this series, we explored the concept of Generative AI and built a simple model that generates text using a bigram model and a single-layer NN. In this part, we will build a more complex model using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to generate text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason behind using MLP is that N-gram models suffer from the curse of dimensionality. As the size of the n-gram increases, the number of possible n-grams grows exponentially. This makes it difficult to store and process the n-grams. In contrast, MLP can learn the patterns in the data and generate text without the need to store all possible n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper \"A Neural Probabilistic Language Model\" by Yoshua Bengio et al., the authors proposed a neural network-based language model that can learn to predict the next word in a sentence. We are going to use a similar approach but our focus is on generating the next character in a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the first part, we will use the names of the characters in the Lord of the Rings series as our dataset. Our source data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data)."
